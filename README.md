1) What is the difference between null and undefined?
   Ans: Null occurs when the user does not want to insert any value. Undefined occurs when the user declares a variable but forgets to assign a value then JS treats it's undefined.
2) What is the difference between == and ===?
  Ans:  == it checks only the value suppose 5=="5" in this case its true because we only check the value here.
        === its heck both value and type 5=="5" its wrong because one is string other one is number
